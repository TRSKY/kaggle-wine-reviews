## GOAL:
---------
Use the description to find variety, winery and location

## Idea
---------
1. Featurize the description 

2. Make a model to see if clusters arise in the description features with regards to class
	- Thinking that graphing feature frequency for each tag starting with variety is a good idea
3. Isolate a test set and a training set

4. Try using eigen decompisition and seeing the accuracy or ideas gathered from that. 

5. Maybe see if we can deduce some linear decision boundaries or if the data has some obvious distributions. 

6. Think about adapting neural nets. 

## Description Study
---------

1. Shingle the description by attaching stop words to normal words. 

2. Look into NLP theory for better ideas to parse the description.
